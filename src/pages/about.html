            <p><strong>It’s a week where businesses including bakers, coffee shops,offices and even schools can take part and pull out all the stops to raise money for a worthwhile cause, and sell lots of yummy doughnuts at the same time. It’s so easy to get involved and help your business increase sales of doughnuts. 
                All you have to do is complete the online registration form (which can be found in the ‘Register’ section of this website). The registration fee is £5 and 100% of the fee goes to The Children’s Trust. You will then be sent a National Doughnut Week pack full of point of sale materials from CSM for you to display to ensure that your customers know when the week is taking place.
