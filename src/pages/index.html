It provides a splash of colour in what can be a beige industry and adds fun for our customers who love supporting the charity through the eating of doughnuts.</p>
                <p>“We advise adding some variety to your doughnuts. It doesn’t have to be complicated but the interest helps drives sales. We always choose a theme and create a range of doughnuts to match, giving us a focus on how to decorate our shops, dress up and create our games.</p>
                <p>“Our theme last year was ‘Circus’ and our doughnuts included The Ring Master, Dotty Clown, Toffee Popcorn, and even an American Hotdog Doughnut called The Strongman.”</p>
